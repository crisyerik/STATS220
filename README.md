<!-- Projects -->
## Here's my projects so far (as of 07.02)

### Project One
<ins> **Part A**: This GitHub Page! </ins>

As part of Project One, I needed to create a new repository in GitHub called "stats220" and make a README.md file that demonstrated (at the bare minimum) the following:
* Use of two different levels of headers ‚úÖ
* Use of two different types of bullet points (ordered and unordered)... Now count to three with me! ‚úÖ
  1. One!
  2. Two!
  3. Three!
* Use of **bold** and *italics* (what about ***both!***) ‚úÖ
* Use of links to other websites ‚úÖ


<ins> **Part B**: Meme Creation </ins>

I did this part... I promise! 

<ins> **Part C**: HTML Creation </ins>

I also did this part!
