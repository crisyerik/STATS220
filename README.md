## This page is a work in progress, but here's my projects so far!

### Project One
**Part A**: This GitHub Page! 

As part of Project One, I needed to create a new repository in GitHub called "stats220" and make a README.md file that demonstrated (at the bare minimum) the following:
* Use of two different levels of headers ‚úÖ
* Use of two different types of bullet points (ordered and unordered)... Now count to three with me! ‚úÖ
  1. One!
  2. Two!
  3. Three!
* Use of **bold** and *italics* (what about ***both!***) ‚úÖ
* Use of links to other websites ‚úÖ


**Part B**: Meme Creation

I did this part... I promise! ‚úÖ

**Part C**: HTML Creation

I also did part... ‚úÖ

That's it for Part A ~
Thanks for reading this readme :)
